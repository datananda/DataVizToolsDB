# Data Visualization Tools Database

Finding a data visualization tool that meets your needs can be hard. The Data Visualization Tools Database (DVTDB) seeks to catalog data visualization tools making it easy to:

- :mag: Find a Tool - fill out a quick questionnaire to find the perfect tool for your use case
- :card_index: View All Tools - browse the tools in the catalog and learn about what different tools have to offer
- :heavy_plus_sign: Add a Tool - fill out a quick questionnaire to add a new tool to the database

## Getting Started

If you want to mess around with the code behind the DVTDB, you will need node. Install the required node packages:

```
npm install
```

Start the server using node:

```
node server.js
```
